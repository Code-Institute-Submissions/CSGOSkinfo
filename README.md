# **CSGO Skinfo**

## **Goal for this project**

If you're a CSGO player then you will know that when it comes to new released skins it's not very easy to find all the information regarding that skin.

CSGO Skinfo will show all the new skins that are released with images so you can see for yourself what the skin is like. There will also be links for that skin which will take you to the steam market. 

So next time there is a new skin release you know where to come.

Thanks for taking a look at my project :) 
If there are any improvements, questions or anything at all then please get in touch.

### Design Choices
   I have used CSGO (Counter Strike Global Offensive) custom maps to come up with a colour scheme that creates a CSGO feel. For this website, I want to bring familiarity to CSGO users that it was CSGO themed one thing came to mind as a CSGO player myself this was a Orange and white themed website with dark accents for example a dark background navigation bars with white text with a orange with white boxes background for the body to create the CSGO feel. The reason for this is to bring familiarity as soon as you enter the website.

#### Colours
  I have decided to use colours which bring familiarity from CSGO players but also capture attention of users which aren't familar to CSGO with dark backgrounds with dark accents as when I ran the background colour through [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color picker to get information for colour blindess, contrast checker and more I discovered that the background colour **#ED7F00** I wanted to use to bring familiarity was not a poor choice for contrast therefore I will use **#212529** backgrounds within a **#ED7F00** background with **EEFFEE** for text this gives a super 14.82 rating within the contrast checker.

  ![CSGO Skinfo Colour Scheme](/wireframes/CSGOSkinfo-colour-scheme.png "CSGO Skinfo Colours")

  * **#ED7F00** with white boxes created with **FFFFFF**.
  * **212529** secondary backgrounds that content sits inside.
  * **EEFFEE** for text within secondary backgrounds.
  * **FFAE51** for hovering over white links.

#### Fonts
  To decide which fonts I want to use I used [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) to find a font which was similar to the kind of website I wanted something which had game aspects to it I have chose to use [Gameplay](https://www.dafont.com/gameplay.font) for titles, subtitles and links as for body text I chose [Game Over Cre](https://www.dafont.com/game-over-cre.font) as this is similar but also includes lowercase fonts.
