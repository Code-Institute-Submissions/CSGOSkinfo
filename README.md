# **CSGO Skinfo**

## **Goal for this project**

If you're a CSGO player then you will know that when it comes to new released skins it's not very easy to find all the information regarding that skin.

CSGO Skinfo will show all the new skins that are released with images so you can see for yourself what the skin is like. There will also be links for that skin which will take you to the steam market. 

So next time there is a new skin release you know where to come.

Thanks for taking a look at my project :) 
If there are any improvements, questions or anything at all then please get in touch.
